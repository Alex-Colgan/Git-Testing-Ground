            <p>You warm yourself by the fire and your frozen extremities regain their strength.
            The room now illuminated reveals two doors, each with a guard, and a small table with a note.
            The note reads;</p>
            
            <p>You are a prisoner in a room with two doors and two guards. One of the doors will guide you to freedom and behind the other is death -- you don't know which is which.<br>
                One of the guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You don't know which one is the truth-teller or the liar either.<br>
                You have to choose and open one of these doors, but you can only ask a single question to one of the guards.<br>
                What do you ask so you can pick the door to freedom?</p><br>
